## Documentation

Documentation is available on Hexdocs [HERE](https://hexdocs.pm/lxd)

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `lxd` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lxd, "~> 0.1.7"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

TODO

## Configuration
`:remote` - Set it to `true` if you want to connect with remote LXD API.

`:url` - LXD API URL - works only with `remote: true`

`:socket` - LXD API socket location only with `remote: false` (default)

`:api_version` - LXD API Version with leading slash, default '/1.0'

`:http_opts` - [HTTPoison](https://hexdocs.pm/httpoison/HTTPoison.html#request/5) as described in documentation.

Example:
```elixir
config :lxd,
       socket: "/var/lib/lxd/unix.socket",
       http_opts: [
         recv_timeout: :infinity
       ]
```

Advanced example with `:hackney` options:
```elixir
config :lxd,
       remote: true,
       url: "https://lxd.dev:8443",
       http_opts: [
         hackney: [
           ssl_options: [
             certfile: "priv/certs/lxd-dev.crt",
             keyfile: "priv/certs/lxd-dev.key"
           ]
         ]
       ]
```


## Contributing

This version of the project is very early. I have implemented what I needed for my projects using LXD containers and now working on it when I have some time.


I am new to Elixir and LXD, so your help and advices are more than welcome on this project.


Here a few things I have in mind to work on:
- Implement missing endpoints (you can find the list of the coverage status for all LXD endpoints down below).
- Found a way to test everything without doing any damage to the host running the test (maybe by using a LXD/docker container with LXD installed on it)
- Add better coverage for tests.


## How to contribute

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
